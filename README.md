# Data Audit & Intelligence Tool

> Automated dataset validation and readiness scoring system for data science workflows.

---

## 📘 Overview

The Data Audit & Intelligence Tool is designed to inspect, validate, and score datasets for quality, structure, and machine learning readiness. It identifies schema inconsistencies, missing data, and other anomalies, helping data scientists prepare cleaner, more reliable datasets. The tool acts as a foundation for building feature-rich and audit-compliant ML pipelines.

- Type: Streamlit App  
- Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy  
- Status: In Development  

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Automated dataset audit with detailed readiness scoring.  
- Schema validation and conformity checks.  
- Actionable recommendations for data cleaning and feature enhancement.

Explain briefly how your components fit together:
- `audit.py` performs validation and quality checks on datasets.  
- `readiness.py` computes ML readiness scores and recommendations.  
- Streamlit UI integrates all results into a clean, interpretable report.
